# Introduction

**xDrip4iOS** (also known as **"xDrip for iOS"** or **"xdripswift"**) is an open-source application to display real time blood glucose data.

**xDrip4iOS** is also available on the App Store under the name [**Shuggah**](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/shuggah/id1586789452). The Shuggah release is done by third-party is not directly managed by the xDrip4iOS project team.

It is able to connect as a **Master** device to various types of Continuous Glucose Monitor systems and display their values on the screen. This is the main way that most people (usually patients with Type 1 Diabetes) will use the app.

It is also able to act as a **Follower** device and pull remote CGM data from online sources such as [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/) or LibreLinkUp. This is a great way for parents and care-givers to be able to remotely monitor loved ones and patients.

!!!info "FOR XDRIP+ USERS"
    Please note that **xDrip4iOS** is not related to the **xDrip+** project for **Android**.

    For help and information about the **xDrip+** project for Android, please see [here](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) or look on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/xDripG5).


## What Do I Need?

üì± To run xDrip4iOS you will need an iPhone 7 or newer running **minimum iOS 16.2**. 

‚åöÔ∏è If you want to use a connected Apple Watch, then it must be a Series 4 or newer running **minimum watchOS 10**.

To work as a **Master** device, you will need to have a compatible CGM system (see below). If you want to share your CGM data with Nightscout, then you will also need a working internet connection.

To work as a **Follower** device, you don't need anything except a working internet connection and a working/compatible data source from where to download glucose values and "follow" a master device.

That's it. Nothing else is needed.

!!!warning "IMPORTANT"
    **Before using xDrip4iOS**, it is important to understand several points:

    - This is an open-source, community-based project and is not supported by any company
    - It is not officially approved or regulated for diabetes therapy and/or treatment in any way whatsoever
    
    **You must understand that you take full responsibility for using this software and you agree to do so at your own risk.**

### Dexcom 

#### Dexcom G4 / G5

- <span style="color:orange">This sensor is now considered **obsolete**</span>
- Master: <span style="color:green">**Compatible**</span> with a bridge/Wixel device and using raw data mode.
</br> 

#### Dexcom G6

- Master: <span style="color:green">**Compatible**</span> using native mode.

All G6 transmitters (including older pre-firefly 80xxxx/81xxxx transmitters) will work in **native mode** using the algorithm inside the transmitter. This means that they will have a 2 hour warm-up, a factory 10 day sensor expiry and a 90-110 day transmitter life. 

The sensors can be started using the sensor code on the label and can be calibrated from inside the xDrip4iOS app.

You can connect to the G6 transmitters in two ways:

1. By using only xDrip4iOS and *without using the Dexcom app*
2. By using xDrip4iOS and the Dexcom app in parallel by enabling "Read from Dexcom app" mode.
</br> 

#### Dexcom G6 (Anubis)

If using a modified **Anubis** G6 transmitter, this will be automatically recognised by xDrip4iOS (from version 5.4.1 onwards) and the Anubis-specific limits (50 minute warm-up, 60 day sensor expiry, 180 day transmitter expiry, resetable) all apply. For more information about the Anubis project, please see the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/310545804061135).
</br> 

#### Dexcom ONE

- **<span style="color:green">Compatible</span>** using native mode with **"Read from Dexcom app" enabled** (see below).
 
Dexcom ONE transmitters  will work in **native mode** using the algorithm inside the transmitter. This means that xDrip4iOS will have a 2 hour warm-up, a factory 10 day sensor expiry and a 90-110 day transmitter life. 

The sensors can be started using the sensor code on the label.

Note that ONE transmitters with a transmitter ID **starting with C** (Cxxxxx) can only be used with "Read from Dexcom App" enabled. They also **cannot be calibrated** from within xDrip4iOS.
</br> 

!!!info "READ FROM DEXCOM APP"

    If you need to use the official Dexcom app to upload data to Dexcom Share or Clarity, you can set xDrip4iOS to "Read from Dexcom App" mode. 
    
    In this mode, the main connection between the transmitter and your iPhone is handled by the Dexcom app. xDrip4iOS will simply receive a copy of the transmitted data and process it. This allows you to use xDrip4iOS for all features (alarms, graphs, statistics, Nightscout, Watch app etc) without needing to stop using the official app.

    Note that this option is always used by default for G7/ONE+/Stelo so does not appear as an option in the app.


#### Dexcom G7

- Master: <span style="color:green">**Compatible**</span> (Dexcom G7 app must be running at the same time).
</br> 

#### Dexcom ONE+

- Master: <span style="color:green">**Compatible**</span> (Dexcom ONE+ app must be running at the same time).
</br> 

#### Dexcom Stelo

- Master: <span style="color:green">**Compatible**</span> (Dexcom Stelo app must be running at the same time).

## Development History

This project was started back in 2017 by **Johan Degraeve**. His idea was to port the original [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/) algorithm to iOS.

The original project he created was called **[xdripiosreader](https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/iosxdripreader)**. This was later re-written in 2019 into native swift code and renamed to **xdripswift**.

In 2020, the user interface was overhauled, more features were added and the user-facing project was renamed to **xDrip4iOS**.
