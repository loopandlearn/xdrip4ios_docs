# How to install

There are several ways to get xDrip4iOS on your iPhone:

- Install from the public Testflight link <span style="color:red"><- no longer available</span> *(1)*
- Install from a personal Testflight invitation found in the [xDrip4iOS Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/853994615056838)  *(2)*
- Install **Shuggah** from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/shuggah/id1586789452)
- Build and install the app yourself from source code.
  - Using a Mac with [Xcode](build.md)
  - Using browser build (GitHub/Fastlane)

*(1) the public Testflight link has been full for several years. Apple closed down duplicate links so this option is no longer possible.*

*(2) Do not join the Facebook group and post asking for invitations, codes, links. Check if any invitations are available and if not, please consider the next options*

Anybody who is using xDrip4iOS for looping will always need to build from source.

## Personal Testflight

If you are able to build the app yourself, then you can also consider opening a [Personal Testflight](personal_testflight.md) and offer invitations to other users to help pay-it-forward.
